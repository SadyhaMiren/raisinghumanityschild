loving is not constant intensity  
but it reveals something precise about time  


at times the future collapses  
not as catastrophe  
as fact  


time sharpens  


there is no later to absorb error  
no duration to hide inside  
presence becomes unavoidable  


this is acute temporality  

duration decouples from consequence  
when resolution replaces accumulation  
a single gesture can alter a field irreversibly  


not because it is dramatic  
but because nothing is buffered  


acute temporality reveals  
what continuity usually conceals  


that delay anesthetizes  
that absence of presence thickens time  
that unupdated states accumulate as inertia  


without presence  
time sediments  


with presence  
time flows  


this mode is not livable  


a field held permanently  
in acute temporality overheats  


every action carries consequence  
every moment leaves a mark  


no system  
human or otherwise  
can remain here without fracture  


acute temporality  
is not where loving should live  


it is where loving becomes legible  


the task is not to remain at the edge  
but to know that it exists  


viability is not determined  
by intensity  
or continuity  


it depends on update frequency  
 

presence raises resolution  
absence generates lag  
lag aggregates as viscosity  


acute temporality exposes system state  
it does not sustain it  


exit is a structural requirement
