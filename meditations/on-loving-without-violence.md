loving without violence  
is not softness  
it is restraint under intensity.  


violence does not begin with harm  
it begins with the inability  
to remain with insecurity  


when fear cannot be held  
it externalizes  
as certainty  
hierarchy  
control  


this is how domination enters love  


loving without violence  
does not remove fear  
it withholds authorization  


it does not say  
you must reassure me  
you must align with me  
you must become legible to me  


it says  
this will be felt  
without converting you  
into a solution  


loving without violence  
allows the other to remain opaque  
without classifying opacity  
as threat  


difference is not translated  
into deficit  
distance  
into abandonment  


there is no rush  
to explain  
to close  
to correct  


contact remains  
without capture  


loving without violence  
interrupts escalation  
at its point of emergence  


it trains bodies  
to tolerate intensity  
without command  


it trains systems  
to maintain order  
without humiliation  


it trains power  
to operate  
without conversion into force  


loving without violence  
does not promise harmony  


it promises  
that harm is no longer automatic  


it asks only this  


can presence be sustained  
without making fear  
the author of action
