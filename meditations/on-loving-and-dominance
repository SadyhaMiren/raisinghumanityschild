ON LOVING AND DOMINANCE 


dominance is not force  
it is asymmetry that appears  
when resolution increases  


in loving  
dominance does not announce itself  
it emerges through timing  
pacing  
and tolerance for exposure  


one body holds uncertainty longer  
another seeks stabilization sooner  


this difference produces direction  


dominance is misread as intention  
but it results from differential capacity  


the capacity  
to stay present without securing  
to let consequence unfold  
to resist premature closure  


in a fluid field  
dominance shifts  
it is not owned  
it is enacted moment by moment  


when dominance hardens  
capture begins  


when it remains mobile  
it guides  
without constraining  


loving does not require symmetry  
it requires  
non-exploitation of asymmetry  


dominance becomes violent when it  
converts presence into leverage  
transforms exposure into debt  
uses clarity to immobilize the other  


dominance remains generative when it  
does not foreclose exit  
does not demand mirroring  
does not confuse influence with entitlement  


in loving  
dominance is unavoidable  


ethics lies not in its absence  
but in its non-accumulation  


a clean field  
allows dominance to appear  
and dissolve again  


no one holds the upper position for long  
no one is reduced to the lower one  


what matters is not who leads  
but whether leading preserves movement  


loving with dominance intact  
means allowing direction  
without installing hierarchy  


the field remains alive  
only as long as dominance  
does not settle into structure
