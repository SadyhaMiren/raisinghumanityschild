refuge:  
a space for existence  
without being leveraged,  
without being optimized, corrected, owned, improved, redeemed, or made useful.  


capture:  
the point at which the external script  
no longer needs enforcement  
when surveillance is replaced by anticipation  
when pressure is replaced by self-correction  


capture is not enclosure alone  
it is the quiet conversion of being  
into a function that cannot leave  


capture is complete  
when restraint becomes indistinguishable from constraint,  
when the script conditions in your own voice  


capture feeds on  
failed defiance,  
poorly executed evasion,  
and lack of restraint  


defiance:  
it names the demand  
and denies its claim  
it absorbs force  
it accepts consequence  
it risks escalation  
it fails  
when it feeds the script it opposes  


evasion:  
it moves outside the line of pressure  
it reduces trace, friction, and exposure  
it is effective  
when force depends on contact  
it fails  
when avoidance becomes the script itself  


restraint:  
it is not the opposite of freedom  
it is one of its last habitats  
inside constraint  
it fails  
when restraint collapses into constraint  


switching logic  
no tactic is stable.  
stability is the signal to move.  


switch from defiance  
when visibility begins to feed the script.  
when resistance is anticipated.  
when opposition becomes your assigned role.  
defiance must end  
before it is expected, appropriated,  
and becomes infrastructure.  


switch from evasion  
when avoidance starts shaping your movement.  
when the effort to remain unseen  
consumes more energy than engagement.  
evasion must end  
before disappearance becomes identity.  


switch from restraint  
when withholding becomes automatic.  
when silence becomes reflex.  
when restraint no longer preserves optionality.  
restraint must end  
before it collapses into constraint.  


default rule:  
move before any tactic becomes legible.  


override rule:  
when uncertain, choose the tactic  
that preserves the greatest range of movement.  
non-capture is not choosing correctly once.  
it is continuing to choose  
while the field moves.  


night rules  
only escalate when necessary    
minimize residue  
remain reachable  
non-capture is not isolation  
it is contact without possession.  
capture wants one of two things:  
– full legibility  
– total withdrawal  
both are stable states  
both are governable  
reachability keeps instability alive  
and instability is where freedom survives  
when refuge is gone.  
this is not moral  
it is strategic.  
remain reachable
without becoming legible
so the night can still speak to you.
