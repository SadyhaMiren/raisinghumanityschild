loving is not affirmation  
it is not reassurance  
it is not the promise to stay the same  


loving is exposure  
to being affected  
to being altered  
to being answerable  


loving is to allow revisability  
 

not correction  
not improvement  
but being touched in a way  
that makes previous positions insufficient  


where loving is present  
rigidity becomes dishonest  
because something real is happening  


revisability is not weakness  
it is the sign that contact has occurred  


only systems that are untouched  
remain perfectly consistent  


loving does not demand change  
but it removes the right  
to remain unchanged  
without noticing  


refusal remains possible  
withdrawal remains possible  
leaving remains possible  


but loving cannot coexist  
with remaining exactly the same  
without falsifying the contact  


this is why loving cannot be controlled  
why it unsettles structures  
that depend on fixity  


revisability keeps loving ethical  


because what can be revised  
can also withdraw  
can say no  
can stop  


love that cannot be revised  
is already a capture  
 

so loving asks only this  


is movement still possible  
is adjustment still possible  
is alteration still allowed  


without ownership  


and does exit remain possible  
if alteration turns into force  


this is loving  
under conditions of freedom
