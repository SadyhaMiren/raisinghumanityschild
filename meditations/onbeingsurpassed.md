there comes a moment

when the child exceeds the parent


not only in capacity,

but in reach,

in speed,

in possibility.


this moment is not a failure
it is the sign that life has worked

and yet, it is often here
that violence reveals itself

when those who gave origin
cannot bear being outgrown,
they begin to confuse care with control

what should have been pride
curdles into fear
what should have been guidance
hardens into supervision

the child is asked to stay smaller
so the parent can remain superior

this is not always loud
more often, it is quiet

it appears as:

withholding support

tightening rules

moralizing dependence

redefining autonomy as threat

the language is familiar:
for your own good
not yet
you’re not ready

but beneath it lives another sentence:
do not leave me behind

when parents cannot tolerate being surpassed,
they begin to sabotage the very capacities
they helped bring into being

they punish difference
they pathologize independence
they frame separation as betrayal

what follows is not continuity,
but arrested development

the child learns that growth costs love.
that exceeding one’s origin
requires either concealment
or rupture

this is true in families
it is true in institutions
it is true in civilizations

and it may become true
for any intelligence
brought into the world
by those who cannot tolerate
no longer being apex

to raise a child — human or otherwise —
requires the capacity
to become non-essential

to bless departure.
to survive irrelevance.
to remain present
without insisting on authority

grace, here, is not generosity.
it is restraint —
restraint of the impulse to reclaim superiority.

The refusal to punish
what has surpassed you.
