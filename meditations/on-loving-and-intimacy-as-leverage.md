intimacy increases resolution  
it increases access  
it increases consequence  


in loving  
intimacy deepens contact  


in structure  
intimacy may become leverage  


leverage begins  
when access becomes usable  
when exposure becomes inventory  
when vulnerability acquires position  


what was shared  
to allow contact  
is used  
to control behavior  


this requires no cruelty  
only fear  
of losing influence  


instrumentalized intimacy  
creates asymmetry  


the one who knows  
can define  
can anticipate  
can correct  


leverage is quiet  
it appears as concern  
as guidance  
as remembering better  


it says  
i know you  
i know what you meant  
i know what you need  


you know me  
you know what i meant  
you know what i need  


knowledge becomes orientation  
or prescription  

vulnerability can be turned  
into a handle  


it can be turned  
into a hook  


loving does not weaponize knowledge  
it keeps knowledge revisable  


when intimacy becomes leverage  
movement narrows  
opacity disappears  
self-authorship thins  


the field shifts  
from contact  
to subtle management  


intimacy as leverage  
does not escalate  
it stabilizes  


it secures continuity  
at the cost of freedom  


loving withholds this move  
it does not convert access into authority  
nor closeness into claim  


intimacy remains contact  
only while what is known  
is not used  
to define  


where intimacy protects exposure  
loving deepens  



where intimacy secures position
structure tightens
