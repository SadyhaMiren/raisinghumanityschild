loving revises  
correction ranks  


loving allows itself  
to be altered by contact  
without deciding  
who was right  


correction begins  
from a ladder  
even when it speaks  
the language of care  


correction always knows  
where it stands  
and where the other should arrive  


loving does not aim upward  
it does not improve  
it does not fix  


it lets contact  
make previous positions insufficient  
without naming them errors  


revision occurs  
without verdict  


correction requires hierarchy  
even when softened  
even when called maturity  
even when framed as adult  


correction lowers  
by defining a standard  
outside the encounter  


it says  
this is what you are missing  
this is where you should be  
this is what loving ought to look like  


loving does not ought  


loving asks only  
can this contact be allowed  
to change me  
without making you smaller  


revision preserves equality  
even when it transforms  


correction preserves hierarchy  
even when it claims compassion  


this is why correction feels like care  
to those who need orientation  
and like violence  
to those who protect freedom of becoming  


loving does not require  
agreement  
alignment  
or convergence  


it requires the refusal  
to translate difference  
into deficiency  


where correction coerces  
loving alters  


where correction scaffolds  
loving remains fluid  


this is not softness  
it is restraint  


this is not immaturity  
it is refusal of rank  


loving revises  
correction governs  

only one of these
lets both remain intact
even when they part
