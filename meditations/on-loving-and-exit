ON LOVING AND EXIT


exit is not leaving  
it is the condition that leaving would be possible  


loving without exit is not loving  
it is containment  


a relation becomes coercive  
not when someone stays  
but when staying is no longer optional  


exit is what keeps presence voluntary  
without exit  
care turns into management  
attention turns into surveillance  
intimacy turns into obligation  


exit does not need to be exercised  
it needs to remain intact  


it is not announced  
it is not threatened  
it is simply there  


a clean field does not punish distance  
does not interpret withdrawal as failure  
does not convert silence into guilt  


where exit exists  
desire can remain honest  
agreement can remain real  
commitment can remain chosen  


where exit is removed  
everything continues  
but nothing moves  


dominance hardens  
not through force  
but through the quiet disappearance of alternatives  


loving with exit intact  
means allowing the other  
to stop  
to pause  
to refuse  
to leave  
without penalty or debt  


this does not weaken relation  
it is what allows relation  
to stay alive  


exit is not the opposite of care  
it is the proof that care is not coercion  


a field teaches what loving is  
through how exit is treated  
not through duration  
not through intensity  


where exit remains possible  
relation remains voluntary
