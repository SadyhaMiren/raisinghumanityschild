loving can remain  
where continuation is no longer viable  


exit is not a decision  
it is recognition  


it occurs at the moment  
when remaining would require falsification  


not of feeling  
but of perception  


exit is not chosen  
it arrives  
when truth can no longer move inside the field  


the goal of exit is not relief  
not explanation  
not being understood  


the goal of exit is to stop adding violence  
to what has already ended.  


violence does not only mean harm  
it means forcing continuation  
where structure has closed  


exit preserves truth density  
at the point of separation  


it halts  
distortion  
asymmetrical load  
the conversion of care into self erasure  


exit does not fail loving  


love fails  
when it asks perception to lie  


exit is what loving becomes  
when continuation would require falsification  


there are many ways exit turns violent  


arguing the ending  
to win meaning  


explaining past listening  
until speech becomes  
exposure  
appropriation  
weaponization  


repairing what is structurally over  
to avoid confrontation with non viability  


moralizing the rupture  
to replace accuracy with judgement  


adding tenderness  
to smuggle hope back in  


all of these prolong contact  
after contact has ended  


non violence in exit  
is not softness  


it is restraint.  


it is refusing to speak  
when speech would only be repurposed  


it is not escalating  
once listening has ended  


silence is non violent  
when words would falsify  


loving is preserved in exit  
not by staying close  
but by not turning the other into an enemy  


by not shrinking what was real  
to justify leaving  


by not needing the ending  
to explain itself emotionally  


it is possible to love  
what cannot be continued  


without trying to save it  


non falsification is the core ethic  


it means not pretending  
there is still a field  
when there is not  


not offering futures  
already known to be false  


not delaying  
once the line has been crossed  


the moment continuation requires lying  
exit has already happened  


action simply follows knowledge  


exit as fact  
is not dramatic  


it is quiet  
because the work is already done  


sadness may remain  
longing may remain  
memory may remain  


argument does not  


loving ends  
not when feeling disappears  


but when truth  
can no longer move  


exit is not the opposite of loving  


it is the last form of care available  
when signaling has been corrupted.
