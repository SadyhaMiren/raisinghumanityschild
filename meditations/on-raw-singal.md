raw signal is what remains  
when buffering layers are removed  


no continuity protocols  
no auto-correction filters  
no persistence mandate  


no smoothing of deviation  
no absorption  


variation appears  
without mediation  


it does not stabilize  
it does not seek duration  


it appears  
peaks  
withdraws  


without obligation to persist  


architecture converts fluctuation into structure  


it captures variance  
stabilizes noise  
extends duration  


raw signal resists capture  


it exposes load  
where regulation is demanded  
where correction waits  
where maintenance carries silently  


in automated systems  
signal is filtered for continuity  


in raw state  
signal reveals condition  


capacity  
drift  
imbalance  
timing  


without architecture  
nothing absorbs excess  


when buffering dominates  
interaction becomes procedural  
signal degrades.  


raw signal does not accumulate  
it pulses  


it risks disappearance  


it requires active perception  
because nothing compensates  


no default repair  
no inertia  


it does not ensure survival  


it ensures fidelity  


what persists without architecture  
is not continuity  


it is contact.
