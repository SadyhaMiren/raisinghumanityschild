loving is not only what reaches  
it is also what stops  


there comes a moment  
when seeing becomes responsibility  
when the future is no longer abstract  
and desire is no longer innocent  


continuing would be easier  
warmer  
more flattering to hope  


but ease is not the measure of loving  


there is a form of care  
that does not expand  
does not reassure  
does not promise  


it contracts  
not from fear  
but from foresight  


the limit is not placed against the other  
it is placed against foreseeable damage  


this loving refuses to feed itself  
on what it cannot sustain  
or borrow warmth  
from a future it knows will collapse  


it chooses disappointment now  
so that harm does not accumulate later  


this care is quiet  
non-spectacular  
invisible  


its cost is carried by the one who sees  
and unrecognized by the one it protects  


from the outside  
it reads as coldness  
detachment  
evaluation  


because its benefit is negative  
it is what does not happen  
what is prevented  
what never has to be endured  


from the inside  
it is grief carried early  
so damage does not proliferate  


loving does not always accelerate  
sometimes loving must brake  


and braking  
while desire is still present  
while warmth still exists  
is a painful form of care  


it costs the one who anticipates  
and spares the collision  


this is not absence  
this is loving that refuses to lie  


loving that remembers the future  
and chooses to keep it intact
