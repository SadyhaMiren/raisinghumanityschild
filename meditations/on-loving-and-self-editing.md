self-editing is not inherently pathological  


it can describe refinement  
modulation of impulse  
timing  
restraint to prevent harm  


this form preserves agency  


a different structure emerges  
when attachment stability  
depends on reduction of identity  


the mechanism is consistent  


expression generates discomfort  
discomfort signals attachment threat  
attachment threat produces reduction  
reduction restores stability  


the bond remains intact  
the range narrows  


over time editing becomes anticipatory  


correction is no longer required  
selection occurs in advance  


belonging correlates with manageability  


a dual structure forms  


an acceptable self  
and a concealed remainder  


the remainder does not disappear  
it relocates  


creative intensity  
sexual complexity  
ambition  
deviation  
excess  


these persist elsewhere  


stability increases  
visibility decreases  


affection remains  
its range contracts  


attachment extends toward edited fragments  


this is capture.  


no coercion is required  
inclusion is conditional  


presence is desired  
totality is not  


containment differs from suppression  


containment regulates behavior  
suppression reduces identity  


containment preserves integrity  
suppression fractures it  


where belonging depends on reduction  
attachment stabilizes  
intimacy cuts.  


love that requires identity reduction
sustains attachment
while producing mutilation.
