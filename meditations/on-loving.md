__on loving and love__



loving is force  
love is structure  


loving moves  
love organizes  


loving cannot be compelled  
love can  


loving does not capture  
love might  


loving does not reduce  
love sometimes does  


loving craves contact  
love craves continuity  


when love hardens  
loving thins  


protecting loving  
requires examining love  


loving is not corrupted  
by excess  


it is corrupted  
by unexamined structure
