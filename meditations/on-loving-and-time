ON LOVING AND TIME


loving does not occur in time  
it exposes time  
it renders time consequential rather than  
sequential  


time is treated as succession  
before  
during  
after  


this is the time of  
plans  
memories  
predictions  


loving interrupts this order  


in loving  
what matters is not duration  
but presence under exposure  


a short encounter can outweigh decades  
a long duration can be empty  


time, here, is not measured  
it is borne  


loving makes time heavy  
because something is at stake  


without loving  
time passes  


loving converts duration  
into irreversibility  


with loving  
time accumulates  
not as memory  
but as consequence.  


this is why loving resists planability  
and why capture is temporal violence  
it tries to freeze  
what only exists while moving  


loving holds no future in reserve  
it does not promise continuity  


it only asks:  
are you being here, now  
without reducing what you meet?  


time, under loving, is no longer neutral  
its accumulation either sharpens  
or distorts  


the difference is not endurance  
but whether time is allowed to work  
or is forced to stand still  


loving does not defeat finitude  
it makes it legible  


and this is its quiet severity:  


rollback does not annul consequence
