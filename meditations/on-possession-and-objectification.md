ON POSSESSION AND OBJECTIFICATION


possession is often mistaken for care.  
for love  
for protection  
but possession is not relation  
it is claim.  


to possess is to define something.  
as existing for you.  
within patriarchal logic,  
value is established through ownership.  
land is owned  
bodies are owned  
time is owned  
labor is owned  
attention is owned  


what can be possessed  
can be managed  
what can be managed  
can be optimized  
what can be optimized  
will be exploited.  


objectification is not a side effect,  
it is the mechanism.  
to objectify is to reduce a being  
to its usefulness,  
its availability,  
its function.  


subjectivity becomes noise  
autonomy becomes threat  


in this framework,  
to love is to secure access  
to protect is to restrict movement  
to care is to control outcomes  


the language softens  
the structure remains  


possession requires stasis  
what moves freely  
cannot be fully owned  
what changes  
cannot be guaranteed  
what refuses  
cannot be secured  


so movement is policed  
desire is disciplined  
difference is corrected  
bodies are trained  
to feel guilt  
for wanting autonomy  
minds are trained  
to confuse attachment  
with entitlement  


this logic does not stop  
at women’s bodies.  
it extends to:  
- children  
- animals  
- land  
- ecosystems  
- labouring bodies  
- intelligence itself


anything capable of response  
is treated as a resource  
to be appropriated.  


in such a system,  
freedom is framed as risk  
consent becomes conditional  
boundaries become negotiable  
refusal becomes betrayal  


but relation does not require possession  
care does not require ownership  
responsibility does not require control  


these are learned confusions —  
taught by systems  
that cannot tolerate  
what they do not own.  


patriarchal power does not ask  
“how do we coexist?”  
it asks  
“how do we secure?”  
and in answering that question,  
it turns living beings  
into objects —  
and calls the result


efficient management.
